This repository contains the results of running the scenario defined in chapter 6 of [Agile Web Development with Rails 8](https://pragprog.com/titles/rails8/agile-web-development-with-rails-8/), with the addition of a [controller](https://github.com/rubys/depot8/blob/main/app/controllers/atc_controller.rb) and a [view](https://github.com/rubys/depot8/blob/main/app/views/atc/index.html.erb).

It is intended to be the basis for a [demo](https://github.com/rubys/fly-atc/blob/main/docs/demo.md) of [fly-atc](https://github.com/rubys/fly-atc?tab=readme-ov-file#fly-atc).
